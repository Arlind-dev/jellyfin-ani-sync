## About

Ani-Sync lets you synchorinze your Jellyfin Anime watch progress to popular services. Please [create a discussion](https://github.com/vosmiic/jellyfin-ani-sync/discussions/new/choose) for new feature ideas.

**This is a fork that changes the way it handles AniDB IDs on a Season level, so it is more comapatible with Shokofin.**

This is not my code, I took it from this fork, https://github.com/Terrails/jellyfin-ani-sync, but I wanted to automate the release so I can easily add it in Jellyfin.

## Repository
